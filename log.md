**Day 2: 2020-05-17**

Installed Adobe XD.  Created account at SwaggerHUB for the RESTful API design.  Started log.md.  Learned about markdown and that .md stands for markdown!

**Day 3: 2020-05-18**

Learned how to use Adobe XD.  Finished rough prototype.  Defined basic functionality.

---

**Day 4: 2020-05-19**

**Day 5: 2020-05-20**

Started coding in Node.js.  Watched a few YouTube videos.  Wondered why Node.js is ES5.  Finished MongoDB CRUD.

**Day 6: 2020-05-21**

Completed REST API for /api/users.

---

**Day 7: 2020-05-22**

Rewrote back-end completely using a better architecture.  Improved separation between controllers, middleware, models, and routes.  Got JWT working for the first time!

---

**Day 8: 2020-05-23**
Watched a number of YouTube videos on the state of npm and Node.  Interested to see the development of Deno.  Did some back-end code clean up.

**Day 9: 2020-05-24**

Started working on some JavaScript problems on Codewars.  Started React front-end.  Back-end needs more work, but will get to that later.

Working on the title by introducing a React component called "Note".  The Note component should be reuseable for the actual notes the user would edit.

---

**Day 13: 2020-05-28**

Figured out prototypal inheritance.
https://zeekat.nl/articles/constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.html

function MyConstructor() { }
let myobj = new MyConstructor();
MyConstructor.prototype.constructor === MyConstructor // true
MyConstructor.__proto__.constructor === MyConstructor // false
myobj.__proto__.constructor === MyConstructor // true
